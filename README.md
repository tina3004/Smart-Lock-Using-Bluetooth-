# Smart-Lock-Using-Bluetooth-
In this project, we implement a smart lock using Bluetooth technology. It uses ESP 32 microcontroller and Android- based app for door lock and unlock mechanism. ESP 32 is programmed using Arduino IDE and the password to unlock the lock is set. The system is controlled using a Bluetooth enabled smart phone. The ESP 32 is connected to the smart phone via Bluetooth wherein the user enters the password through the app. If the entered password is correct, the lock is opened. Else if an incorrect password is entered, the lock will not open and an incorrect password prompt is displayed on the app.
